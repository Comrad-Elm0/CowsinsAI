# Documentation
This asset was made using duplicates of some files made for the FPS Engine. Main assets (Player Controller etc) don't need to be modified for this asset to work. The Cowsins AI is made using a modified version of the Enemy.cs script (this will be modified as the asset updates) called EnemyAI.cs which is used within AI Health Manager.cs.
> Note, this asset was made using Unity version 2021.3.13f1 and using the Universal Render Pipeline, the only custom textures used for this was the demo characters and the demo materials.

The actual Cowsins AI is viewable within the 'Demo' scene in Assets > Cowsins AI > Scenes > Demo. This is just a basic environment using the Shooter variant of the AI. Others are avaialable in Assets > Cowsins AI > Prefabs.

## Installation Instructions
In order for this asset to work, the 'Release' file **must** be dropped in the main Assets folder of your project. In order to stay updated for future updates, you need to ensure that the folder stays in that location.
